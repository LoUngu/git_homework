I worked with git before and it was not that challenging for me to do the homework.

As a general feedback regarding the assignment, 
I think the steps are pretty clear for someone that
had some previous contact with Git and Github, but
I think that for someone that has never had hands-on
experience, some additional individual research is needed.
